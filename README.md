This was a **NTUA** project that I did during my mobility with the **ERASMUS+ Program**

I created a **Netflix copy** with 2 main use cases, I used **TMDB** to display the movies
and get their information. Also, I used **Google Auth** and **Firebase** to let users create
accounts. The whole project is described using "**visual paradigm**". Also a **showcase video** can be found among project files!
